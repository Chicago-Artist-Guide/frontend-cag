    <p>
      When you use our Services you agree to all of these terms. Your use of our
      Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy,

      You agree that by clicking “Join Now”, “Join Chicago Artist Guide”, “Sign
      Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services (described
      below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with
      Chicago Artist Guide (even if you are using our Services on behalf of a
      company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User
      Agreement”), do not click “Join Now” (or similar) and do not access or
      otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this contract,
      at any time you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing
      or using our Services.
    </p>
    <p id="bold">Services</p>
    <p>
      This Contract applies to Chicagoartistguide.org, Chicago Artist
      Guide-branded apps, and other CAG-related sites, apps, communications and
      other services that state that they are offered under this Contract
      (“Services”), including the offsite collection of data for those Services,
      such as our ads and the “Apply with Chicago Artist Guide” and “Share with
      CAG” plugins. Registered users of our Services are “Members” and
      unregistered users are “Visitors”.
    </p>
    <p id="bold">Chicago Artist Guide</p>
    <p>
      You are entering into this Contract with Chicago Artist Guide (also
      referred to as “we”, “us”, and “CAG”).
    </p>
    <p id="bold">This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.</p>
    <p>
      As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of
      your personal data is subject to this Privacy Policy (which includes our
      Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and
      updates.
    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">1.2 Members and Visitors</h3>
    <p>
      When you register and join the CAG Services, you become a Member. If you
      have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain
      features as a “Visitor.”
    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">1.3 Change</h3>
    <p id="bold">We may make changes to the Contract.</p>
    <p>
      We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy
      from time to time. If we make material changes to it, we will provide you
      notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the
      opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree
      that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may
      close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or
      send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are
      consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Obligations</h3>
    <h3 className="subtitle">2.1 Service Eligibility</h3>
    <p id="bold">
      Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:
    </p>
    <p id="bold">
      You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our
      “Minimum Age.”
    </p>
    <p>The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 18.</p>
    <p>
      To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the “Minimum Age”
      (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one CAG account; and
      (3) you are not already restricted by CAG from using the Services.
      Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms,
      including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age
      of 16.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Minimum Age” means 18 years old. However, if law requires that you must
      be older in order for CAG to lawfully provide the Services to you without
      parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum
      Age is such older age.
    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">2.2 Your Account</h3>
    <p id="bold">You will keep your password a secret.</p>
    <p id="bold">
      You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules
      and the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and
      keep it confidential; (2) not transfer any part of your account (e.g.,
      connections) and (3) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and
      Professional Community Policies. You are responsible for anything that
      happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs
      to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you
      to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for
      such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your
      use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your
      personal account.
    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">2.3 Notices and Messages</h3>
    <p>
      You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our
      websites, apps, and contact information. If your contact information is
      out of date, you may miss out on important notices.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the
      following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the contact
      information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical
      address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from
      us.
    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">2.4 Sharing</h3>
    <p>
      When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use
      that information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such
      as your profile, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job
      postings, and messages. Information and content that you share or post may
      be seen by other Members, Visitors or others (including off of the
      Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the
      choices you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message
      content to your addressees, sharing content only to CAG connections,
      restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to
      notify others of your CAG profile update). For job searching activities,
      we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So, if
      you apply for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are
      interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service
      and can remove it with or without notice.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Rights and Limits</h3>
    <h3 className="subtitle">
      3.1 Your License to Chicago Artist Guide (aka “CAG”)
    </h3>
    <p>
      You own all of the content, feedback and personal information you provide
      to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive license to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your information
      and content, including how it can be used for ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      As between you and CAG, you own the content and information that you
      submit or post to the Services, and you are only granting CAG and our
      affiliates the following non-exclusive license:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy,
          modify, distribute, publish and process, information and content that
          you provide through our Services and the services of others, without
          any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others.
          These rights are limited in the following ways:
        </p>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            You can end this license for specific content by deleting such
            content from the Services, or generally by closing your account,
            except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the
            Service and they copied, re-shared it or stored it and (b) for the
            reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other system.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will not include your content in advertisements for the products
            and services of third parties to others without your separate
            consent (including sponsored content). However, we have the right,
            without payment to you or others, to serve ads near your content and
            information, and your social actions may be visible and included
            with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service
            feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that
            feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to
            publish your content beyond the Services. However, if you choose to
            share your post as "public", we will enable a feature that allows
            other Members to embed that public post onto third-party services,
            and we enable search engines to make that public content findable
            through their services.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as
            translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file
            type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your
            expression.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Because you own your content and information and we only have
            non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to
            others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You and CAG agree that if content includes personal data, it is
            subject to our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You and CAG agree that we may access, store, process and use any
      information and personal data that you provide in accordance with, the
      terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
    </p>
    <p>
      By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to CAG,
      you agree that CAG can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback
      for any purpose without compensation to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You promise to only provide information and content that you have the
      right to share, and that your CAG profile will be truthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the
      law nor anyone’s rights (including intellectual property rights). You also
      agree that your profile information will be truthful. CAG may be required
      by law to remove certain information or content in certain countries.
    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">3.2 Service Availability</h3>
    <p>We may change or end any Service or modify our prices prospectively.</p>
    <p>
      We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also
      modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the
      extent allowed under the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t promise to store or keep showing any information and content that
      you’ve posted. CAG is not a storage service. You agree that we have no
      obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or
      information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by

      otherwise harmful. CAG generally does not review content provided by our
      Members or others. You agree that we are not responsible for others’
      (including other Members’) content or information. We cannot always
      prevent this misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not

      your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others
      when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were
      mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAG may help connect Members offering their services (career coaching,
      accounting, etc.) with Members seeking services. CAG does not perform nor
      employs individuals to perform these services. You must be at least 18
      years of age to offer, perform or procure these services. You acknowledge
      that CAG does not supervise, direct, control or monitor Members in the
      performance of these services and agree that (1) CAG is not responsible
      for the offering, performance or procurement of these services, (2) CAG
      does not endorse any particular Member’s offered services, and (3) nothing
      shall create an employment, agency, or joint venture relationship between
      CAG and any Member offering services. If you are a Member offering
      services, you represent and warrant that you have all the required
      licenses and will provide services consistent with our Professional
      Community Policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, CAG may help you register for and/or attend events organized by

      CHICAGO ARTIST GUIDE AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
      ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE
      UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT

      IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
      MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    <h3 className="subtitle">4.2 Exclusion of Liability</h3>
    <p id="bold">These are the limits of legal liability we may have to you.</p>

      TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS CHICAGO ARTIST GUIDE
      HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS
      CONTRACT), CHICAGO ARTIST GUIDE, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE
      LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS
      OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS
      OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION

    </p>
    <h3 className="subtitle">4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions</h3>
    <p>
      The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of
      the bargain between you and Chicago Artist Guide (or “CAG”) and shall
      apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence,
      contract and law) even if CAG or its affiliates has been told of the
      possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their
      essential purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      These limitations of liability do not apply to liability for death or
      personal injury or for fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct,
      or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached, a
      material obligation being such which forms a prerequisite to our delivery
      of services and on which you may reasonably rely, but only to the extent
      that the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable
      upon conclusion of this Contract and to the extent that they are typical
      in the context of this Contract.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Termination</h3>
    <p id="bold">
      We can each end this Contract, but some rights and obligations survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both you and CAG may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to
      the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the
      Services. The following shall survive termination:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p id="bold">Our rights to use and disclose your feedback</p>
        <p>
          Members and/or Visitors’ rights to further re-share content and
          information you shared through the Services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p id="bold">Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract</p>
        <p>

          after termination. You can visit our Help Center to close your
          account.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      In the unlikely event we end up in a legal dispute, you and Chicago Artist
      Guide agree to resolve it in Illinois courts using Illinois law.
    </p>
    <h3>7. General Terms</h3>
    <p id="bold">Here are some important details about the Contract.</p>
    <p>
      If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it
      unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to
      make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court
      cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that
      unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when
      you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between
      us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the
      Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean
      that CAG has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign
      or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to
      anyone without our consent. However, you agree that CAG may assign this
      Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.
      There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses
      provided in Section 10.
    </p>
