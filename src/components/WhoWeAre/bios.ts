Austin is a multidisciplinary artist, practicing music and songwriting, theatre performance, and photography. When he's not coding, plunking tunes, emoting, or snapping... he's... sleeping. What else could there possibly be time for? He's so excited for such an essential yet overlooked project. Chicago is the most segregated city in the US, and the theatre community is not immune to that fact. Here's to working towards more inclusiveness, diversity, and opportunity!"

Pedro's goal is to combine his knowledge of healthcare and software engineering to help the Latin community. To prepare me for that, he joined Chicago Artist Guide to use his engineering skills to make a positive impact within the theater community. \n\nBefore the pandemic hit, Pedro loved to explore the city through its food and events.  Now, he goes for runs and rides his bike along the lakefront to explore new places. Pedro also recently adopted a puppy named Lambo and he's been a bundle of joy to have around."

Noah has coached the youth of the Chicago land area for over 6 years in physical, mental, and relational skills. He is excited to join CAG’s team because of their shared passion for creating connections through community involvement. Providing a service in his hometown only sweetens the opportunity. He loves to game and the opportunities he was given through sports that allowed him to express himself. Since those opportunities are not readily available to everyone, especially artistic minds, he wants to be part of the reason someone gets to experience that.  Find him on a pitch, in the gym, behind his desk, with his dog (son) Chapo.'
