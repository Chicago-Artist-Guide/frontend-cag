Brianna was able to explore these interests during her studies at Agnes Scott College where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Relations and Business Management. Previously, she was active in student organizations including Her Campus (as a Content Creator and Campus Correspondent) and Mortar Board (as a Director of Communications). She was also a Marketing intern at CARE USA, which allowed her to gain experience in website content accessibility. She is motivated by the idea of helping other people have equitable access to opportunities and resources that will allow them to pursue their life goals. During her free time, Brianna enjoys listening to music of pretty much any genre, sketching, painting, and spending time outdoors. She is also an animal lover and enjoys spending time caring for her two pet turtles along with almost any other animals she happens to cross paths with.'
